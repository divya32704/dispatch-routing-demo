This repository demonstrates a minimal RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline:
- It ingests documents and builds a FAISS index using sentence-transformers.
- It then retrieves relevant chunks for a given question and uses an extractive QA model to answer.
- The goal is to showcase clean, reproducible, and containerized ML application code.
